    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      After searching everywhere for a recipe to recreate this amazing dish I
      tried at a Middle Eastern restaurant. I decided to try and make this
      myself. Though not authentic, still is amazing! Enjoy.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups basmati rice</li>
      <li>4 heads garlic, whole</li>
      <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 pounds boneless leg of lamb, cut into 3-inch pieces</li>
      <li>2 large onions, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>5 large carrots, coarsely grated</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons cumin seeds</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons coriander seed</li>
      <li>1/2 cup fresh barberries</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns</li>
      <li>2 cups boiling water to cover</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place basmati rice in a large bowl and cover with warm water. Set aside.
        Wash heads of garlic. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat vegetable oil in a dutch oven or large skillet over high heat until
        smoking, then add lamb, turning occasionally until the lamb is evenly
        browned, about 10 minutes. Stir in the onions; cook and stir until the
        onion has softened and browned, about 10 minutes. Stir in the carrots;
        cook and stir until the carrots have softened, about 10 minutes.
        Sprinkle with cumin, coriander, barberries, and peppercorns. Drop whole
        garlic heads into the mixture, stirring to evenly distribute
        ingredients. Reduce heat to medium. Cover and cook for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wash and drain basmati rice with hot water. Pour cleaned rice over the
        lamb mixture in an even layer. Slowly pour in the boiling water. The
        rice should be covered with about 3/4 inch of water. Do not stir. Season
        with salt, and reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and cook until rice is
        tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, about 20 minutes. Stir rice
        and lamb together, and serve with the garlic heads on top.
