    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Borscht is a classic beet soup that's so comforting and delicious. This
      recipe comes from my Ukrainian friend's mother, who taught me how to make
      it.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
      Borscht is a sour soup that is traditionally made with meat stock and
      boiled vegetables. The Ukrainian version, which features beets, is perhaps
      the most well known type — but varieties of borscht can be found
      throughout Central and Eastern Europe and Northern Asia.
